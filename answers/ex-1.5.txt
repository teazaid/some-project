(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

applicative-order:
(test 0 (p))
step 1: (test 0 (p))
step 2: (test 0 (p))
...
step N: (test 0 (p))

Thus, applicative order evaluation will never end.

normal-order evaluation:
(test 0 (p))

step 1:
(if (= 0 0)
      0
      p))

step 2: 0
